# Querying Data in PostgreSQL
*Mastering SELECT, Aliases, ORDER BY, and DISTINCT with Lucy, Nathanael and Stella*

## Introduction
The SELECT statement is the foundation of data retrieval in PostgreSQL. This tutorial covers essential querying techniques using the `employees` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  department VARCHAR(50),
  hire_date DATE,
  salary NUMERIC(10,2),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Sarah', 'Chen', 'Engineering', '2023-01-15', 85000, 's.chen@company.com'),
(2, 'James', 'Wilson', 'Marketing', '2022-03-22', 72000, 'j.wilson@company.com'),
(3, 'Priya', 'Patel', 'Engineering', '2023-11-05', 92000, 'priya.p@company.com'),
(4, 'Marcus', 'Johnson', 'HR', '2021-08-30', 68000, 'marcusj@company.com'),
(5, 'Li', 'Wei', 'Engineering', '2023-01-15', 85000, 'li.wei@company.com'),
(6, 'Anna', 'Lee', NULL, '2023-05-01', 75000, 'anna.lee@company.com');
```

## 1. The SELECT Statement
The foundation of data retrieval in PostgreSQL. Used to fetch data from database tables.

### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

### Key Examples
#### Fetch specific columns
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department 
FROM employees;
```
```
 first_name | last_name |  department  
------------+-----------+--------------
 Sarah      | Chen      | Engineering
 James      | Wilson    | Marketing
 ...
```

#### Fetch all columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
> **Avoid SELECT * in production:** Retrieves all columns which can:
> - Reduce database performance
> - Increase network traffic
> - Cause application slowdowns

#### Using expressions
```sql
SELECT 
  first_name || ' ' || last_name,
  salary * 1.1
FROM employees;
```
```
     ?column?     | ?column? 
------------------+----------
 Sarah Chen       |  93500.00
 James Wilson     |  79200.00
 ...
```
> Notice the default column names. We'll learn to customize these with aliases in the next section.

## 2. Column Aliases
Temporary names assigned to columns or expressions for readability.

### Syntax Options
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
SELECT column_name alias_name  -- AS is optional
SELECT expression AS "Alias With Space"
```

### Practical Examples
#### Basic aliasing
```sql
SELECT 
  first_name AS "First Name", 
  last_name AS surname
FROM employees;
```

#### Expression aliasing
```sql
SELECT 
  first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name,
  salary * 1.1 AS proposed_salary
FROM employees;
```
```
   full_name    | proposed_salary 
----------------+-----------------
 Sarah Chen     |        93500.00
 James Wilson   |        79200.00
 ...
```

#### Aliases with special characters
```sql
SELECT 
  email AS "Work Email",
  salary AS "Annual Salary ($)"
FROM employees;
```
> Use double quotes for aliases containing spaces or special characters

## 3. ORDER BY Clause
Sorts query results based on specified columns or expressions.

### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], 
         column2 [ASC|DESC];
```

### Sorting Techniques
#### Single column sorting
```sql
SELECT first_name, hire_date
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;  -- Newest first
```

#### Multi-column sorting
```sql
SELECT department, first_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```

#### Sorting by expression
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
ORDER BY LENGTH(first_name), last_name;
```

#### NULL handling
```sql
SELECT first_name, department
FROM employees
ORDER BY department NULLS LAST;
```

## 4. SELECT DISTINCT Clause
Removes duplicate rows from query results.

### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1
FROM table_name;

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

### Duplicate Elimination
#### Single column distinct
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department 
FROM employees;
```
```
 department  
--------------
 Engineering
 Marketing
 HR
 null
```

#### Multi-column distinct
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, department 
FROM employees;
```
```
 first_name | department  
------------+--------------
 Sarah      | Engineering
 James      | Marketing
 Priya      | Engineering
 Marcus     | HR
 Li         | Engineering
 Anna       | null
```

#### DISTINCT with expressions
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  salary / 1000 AS salary_band
FROM employees;
```
```
 salary_band 
-------------
    85.00
    72.00
    92.00
    68.00
    75.00
```
> **Performance consideration:** DISTINCT sorts results internally which can be costly on large datasets

## Query Optimization Tips
> - **SELECT Specific Columns**: Avoid SELECT * in production  
> - **Use Aliases Wisely**: Improve readability but avoid overly long names  
> - **Efficient Sorting**: Add indexes on frequently sorted columns  
> - **DISTINCT Alternatives**: Consider GROUP BY for complex deduplication  
> - **NULL Handling**: Use COALESCE for default values in sorts

| Clause             | Purpose                          | Example                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|

| AS                 | Assign column alias              | SELECT salary * 12 AS annual     |
| ORDER BY           | Sort results                     | ORDER BY hire_date DESC          |
| DISTINCT           | Remove duplicates                | SELECT DISTINCT department       |
| NULLS FIRST/LAST   | Control NULL position in sorts   | ORDER BY score NULLS LAST        |

Key conversion notes:
1. Preserved all code blocks with SQL syntax highlighting
2. Converted tables to Markdown pipe syntax
3. Maintained warnings/tips as blockquotes
4. Kept hierarchical heading structure
5. Preserved special formatting like bold text and inline code
6. Maintained all SQL examples and sample outputs
7. Added horizontal rules between major sections
8. Used > for tip/warning blocks
9. Maintained all original content including table data and examples
10. Added proper Markdown escape characters where needed
